Bhagavad Gita: Chapter 1, Verse 9



अन्ये च बहव: शूरा मदर्थे त्यक्तजीविता: |

नानाशस्त्रप्रहरणा: सर्वे युद्धविशारदा: || 9||

anye cha bahavaḥ śhūrā madarthe tyaktajīvitāḥ
nānā-śhastra-praharaṇāḥ sarve yuddha-viśhāradāḥ

Translation:

 Also, there are many other heroic warriors, who are prepared to lay down their lives for my sake. They are all skilled in the art of warfare, and equipped with various kinds of weapons.

भावार्थ : 
ऎसे अन्य अनेक शूरवीर भी है जो मेरे लिये अपने जीवन का बलिदान देने के लिये अनेक प्रकार के अस्त्र-शस्त्रों से सुसज्जित है और यह सभी युद्ध-विधा में निपुण है। (९)

Commentary

Duryodhana naively tried to impress Drona by glorifying his army. In doing so, his ego resurfaced again, which is evidenced by his self-aggrandizing statements like “they will give up their life for me”. He probably was trying to convince (or delude) himself that his army is poised to win the battle.
 
The tendency of the ego to consider something “mine” is called mamataa in Sanskrit. Mamataa literally means “mine-making” or “mine-ness”. This is yet another means for the ego to strengthen itself through possessions.
